Installation notes (for creating a new release and installing at Diamond)
Updated to give correct order.
=========================================================================

1) Create new install folder (Savu/install/$version_install)
    a) Create folder
    b) Copy all files and folders from previous installation into it
    c) Clone the previous version_future environment and add to it (if future install exists)
        OR if creating new fully updated release (e.g. future version), clone without version numbers
        - conda env export -n root > environment.yml
        - Remove libraries (mpi4py, hdf5, h5py, astra, ccpi/boost, xraylib, savu, pycuda)
    d) Update conda recipes (including version number in savu recipe)

2) a) Update Savu/install/latest_version.py to contain the new version number (and the corresponding file)
   b) Update Savu/install/all_versions.txt file to include this release.
   c) copy the latest module version and update according to the instructions.
    -e.g. create 2.0_stable, 2.0_branch, 2.0_future  (see below)
   d) Update installation notes with the latest tested versions of libraries and new link
   e) Push all changes to Github (ensure all tests passing)

3) Create tar.gz of the new install folder
   >>> tar -zcvf savu_v2.3.tar.gz savu_v2.3/

4) Test conda installation against Savu master version
   a) Download and unzip folder from Savu installation guide
   b) >>> bash /path_to_download/Savu_v2.0/savu_installer.sh -f dls -c 2.3_stable -s master


Need to create a new environment file with version numbers for the release (if all works well)
  - Add new packages first (and to installation)
Check module file again after release (current testing install in scratch location).
